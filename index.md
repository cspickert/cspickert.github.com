# Hi, I'm Cameron Spickert. I'm a software engineer living in New York City.

I'm currently the technical lead on the [Google Play Books][g] iOS team. In the past, I worked at [Oyster][o] and [Aviary][a]. Professionally, I'm passionate about building usable and maintainable software using Swift and Objective-C. In my free time—when I'm not indulging in coffee and/or video games—you might find me exploring the city, and occasionally [teaching and mentoring][c] aspiring software engineers.

Feel free to get in touch at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). You can also find me on [Twitter][t], [GitHub][g], and [LinkedIn][l].
