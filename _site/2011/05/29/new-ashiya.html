  <p><em>This is the first of what will hopefully be an ongoing series about places and businesses I've visited.</em></p>

<p>New Ashiya is a sushi restaurant on 1st Ave in the East Village. It looks pretty innocuous on the outside, but walk inside and you'll immediately see that this isn't your average Japanese restaurant. In addition to their regular menu, they have an all you can eat <em>and drink</em> option for $33 per person. For 2 hours, you can order as much sushi, sake and beer as you can handle (without going overboard--the menu warns of additional charges for wasted food). We opted to try every special roll on the menu (about 10 different kinds), plus some tuna and salmon sashimi. The highlight was definitely the black pepper tuna roll, something I've never seen or tasted anywhere else. Oh, and we did lots of sake bombs.</p>
