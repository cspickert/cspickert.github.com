title: "Implementing Oplop in Python"
---

I've been using [Oplop](http://oplop.appspot.com/) for a while now. It's a great alternative to database-style password management programs like [1Password](http://www.agilebits.com/onepassword), providing the same level of security without compromising portability. While 1Password lets you take your passwords with you via an encrypted file and mobile, web and desktop apps, Oplop makes it so you don't have to take anything with you at all!

One thing I don't like about Oplop, however, is having to go to [oplop.appspot.com](http://oplop.appspot.com/) every single time I need to retrieve my passwords. So I decided to implement [the algorithm](http://code.google.com/p/oplop/wiki/HowItWorks) as a Python script with a simple command line interface.

[Here's the Gist](https://gist.github.com/1259200).

From here, I just need to come up with a way to get passwords generated by the script into web forms and applications automatically. For now, [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) ([+ Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)) and `pbcopy` are doing nicely.
