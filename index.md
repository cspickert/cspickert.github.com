# Hi, I'm Cameron.

I'm a software engineer living in New York City. Currently, I'm the technical lead on the [Google Play Books][p] iOS team. Previously, I worked at [Oyster][o] and [Aviary][a]. Professionally, I'm passionate about building usable and maintainable software using Swift and Objective-C. In my free time—that is, when I'm not indulging in movies or video games—I enjoy exploring the city, and I occasionally [mentor][c] aspiring software engineers.

Feel free to get in touch at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). You can also find me on [Twitter][t], [GitHub][g], and [LinkedIn][l].
