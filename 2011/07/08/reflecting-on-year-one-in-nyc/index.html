            <p>It's been an eventful year since I graduated last summer, made the transition from Cambridge to Bushwick. There's much more to this story, but I'm hoping this quick retrospective will kickstart this blog back into action.</p>
            
            <h3>Work</h3>
            
            <p>A year ago was an exciting time for us: some friends and I had made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rover-unofficial-guide-to/id312281600?mt=8">a successful iPhone app</a> together, been <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704188104575083293556739002.html">profiled by the Wall Street Journal</a>, and received enough money from AT&amp;T to work on mobile apps for schools AND live off of for a year. Times were good.</p>
            
            <p>We worked hard to get our work off the ground, finding our way with AT&amp;T, some of their partner companies, and of course, universities, and ended up deploying the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id441605750?mt=8">Columbia Business School mobile app</a> last month after a year of hard work. While we didn't quite take our business to the level we wanted, we ended up with a product we can be proud of.</p>
            
            <p>As our team heads off in different directions, things are getting exciting once again. I'll have more to tell in a little over a week.</p>
            
            <h3>Life</h3>
            
            <p>I'm convinced I'm a different person than I was when I arrived in New York City. It took a long time for me to get over how dirty, crowded and expensive it can be, but I'm learning to love it here--there really is no place like it. I've particularly enjoyed the <a href="/2011/02/04/music-is-life-is-music/">live music scene</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Bushwick has been great to me, and I'll miss it when I leave for Manhattan. I'm consistently amazed at how lucky we got with our apartment--even though our building has been an unexpected (or unwanted) adventure at times, we're around the corner from the L train, we now have a 24-hour grocery store across the street, and there are restaurants and shops popping up everywhere. We couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the city.</p>
            
            <h3>Happy New Year, NYC!</h3>
            
            <p>I have lots of goals for the next year: getting a bike and commuting above-ground, getting more involved in the NYC startup scene, and meeting more people, to name a few. It's definitely going to be a busy year. Oh, and <a href="/2011/02/04/music-is-life-is-music/">more concerts</a>.</p>
            
            <p>And, once again, I hope to make this blog worth reading!</p>
