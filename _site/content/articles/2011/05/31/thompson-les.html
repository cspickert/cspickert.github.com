<p>I went to a birthday party at a top-floor room at the Thompson LES (LES = "Lower East Side") on Sunday. As far as I can tell, it's the tallest building in the area, which made for an absolutely spectacular night-time view from the private deck. The room spans the length of the building and faces west, making for a perfect view of both the financial district, the Brooklyn Bridge, and midtown. I shudder to think what it would cost to actually stay here, and I'm glad the only cost to me was a bottle of rum.</p>
