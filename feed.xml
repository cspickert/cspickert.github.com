    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my projects at Aviary necessitated generating a static UIImage from a UIView. Fortunately, Quartz makes it really simple to do this. Here's a quick category on UIView showing how it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain: -createImageFromRect: method generates an image by rendering the portion of the view bounded by "frame" in an image context. Note that CALayer's -renderInContext: method renders the entire layer tree, creating a flat image from the view hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened in the past month or two, but the biggest news from me is that I started working at Aviary, Inc. in mid-July. I've been spending a good deal of time at the office, and I'm loving every minute of it. Our building is in the heart of Manhattan, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. We have an amazing roof and a really sketchy elevator. Hmm, reminds me of somewhere in Bushwick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been an eventful year since I graduated last summer, made the transition from Cambridge to Bushwick. There's much more to this story, but I'm hoping this quick retrospective will kickstart this blog back into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago was an exciting time for us: some friends and I had made &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rover-unofficial-guide-to/id312281600?mt=8"&gt;a successful iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; together, been &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704188104575083293556739002.html"&gt;profiled by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and received enough money from AT&amp;amp;T to work on mobile apps for schools AND live off of for a year. Times were good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked hard to get our work off the ground, finding our way with AT&amp;amp;T, some of their partner companies, and of course, universities, and ended up deploying the &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id441605750?mt=8"&gt;Columbia Business School mobile app&lt;/a&gt; last month after a year of hard work. While we didn't quite take our business to the level we wanted, we ended up with a product we can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As our team heads off in different directions, things are getting exciting once again. I'll have more to tell in a little over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced I'm a different person than I was when I arrived in New York City. It took a long time for me to get over how dirty, crowded and expensive it can be, but I'm learning to love it here--there really is no place like it. I've particularly enjoyed the &lt;a href="/2011/02/04/music-is-life-is-music/"&gt;live music scene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bushwick has been great to me, and I'll miss it when I leave for Manhattan. I'm consistently amazed at how lucky we got with our apartment--even though our building has been an unexpected (or unwanted) adventure at times, we're around the corner from the L train, we now have a 24-hour grocery store across the street, and there are restaurants and shops popping up everywhere. We couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Happy New Year, NYC!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of goals for the next year: getting a bike and commuting above-ground, getting more involved in the NYC startup scene, and meeting more people, to name a few. It's definitely going to be a busy year. Oh, and &lt;a href="/2011/02/04/music-is-life-is-music/"&gt;more concerts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, once again, I hope to make this blog worth reading!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to a birthday party at a top-floor room at the Thompson LES (LES = "Lower East Side") on Sunday. As far as I can tell, it's the tallest building in the area, which made for an absolutely spectacular night-time view from the private deck. The room spans the length of the building and faces west, making for a perfect view of both the financial district, the Brooklyn Bridge, and midtown. I shudder to think what it would cost to actually stay here, and I'm glad the only cost to me was a bottle of rum.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first of what will hopefully be an ongoing series about places and businesses I've visited.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Ashiya is a sushi restaurant on 1st Ave in the East Village. It looks pretty innocuous on the outside, but walk inside and you'll immediately see that this isn't your average Japanese restaurant. In addition to their regular menu, they have an all you can eat &lt;em&gt;and drink&lt;/em&gt; option for $33 per person. For 2 hours, you can order as much sushi, sake and beer as you can handle (without going overboard--the menu warns of additional charges for wasted food). We opted to try every special roll on the menu (about 10 different kinds), plus some tuna and salmon sashimi. The highlight was definitely the black pepper tuna roll, something I've never seen or tasted anywhere else. Oh, and we did lots of sake bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
