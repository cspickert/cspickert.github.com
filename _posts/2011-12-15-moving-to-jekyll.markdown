title: "Moving to Jekyll"

It's been a while since I've posted anything around here, and I'd like to change that. Part of the reason for the lack of updates (or so I tell myself) is because [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), while extremely flexible and customizable, proved increasingly difficult to use over time. A major version update broke my build process, and I ended up spending more time engineering my blog than writing--I even had to write [my own gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/nanoc-git) to deploy my site to GitHub. I'm hoping that using a system that integrates better with GitHub will let me get back to what I originally set out to do with this site.
