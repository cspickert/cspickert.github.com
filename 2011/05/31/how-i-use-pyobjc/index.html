            <p>I started iOS development just under two years ago, while I was a senior in college. The Cocoa frameworks are the first major code library I've used, and while the learning curve was quite steep at first, I finally feel like I've reached a level of fluency that allows me to be productive. Part of the reason I feel so much more productive than I did when I started out is because I've discovered some (probably very non-standard) workflows that let me cut down the amount of time it takes me to produce better code.</p>
            
            <p>One of the biggest bottlenecks for me when learning to use new frameworks in Objective-C is the amount of time it takes to experiment. Call me spoiled, but I find the need to recompile my code every time I change a line to be very annoying, especially in light of the ability to hit command-R in TextMate while programming in Ruby or Python and have my code execute immediately.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Enter PyObjC</strong>. PyObjC has to be one of the most underrated (or at least under-mentioned) tools around when it comes to experimenting with the Cocoa frameworks. While it's true that it only gives you access to the Mac frameworks (as opposed to iOS-specific behavior), at least the model code is going to be the same for both Mac and iOS.</p>
            
            <p>One simple statement gives you access to the Foundation classes (others, like Core Data and Address Book, are also available):</p>
            
            <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from Foundation import *
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>After that, you can experiment away. For example, if you want to test out the syntax and behavior of collection operators on NSSet instances, you can go nuts:</p>
            
            <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; setOfSets = NSSet.setWithObjects_(
            ...     set([1,2,3]),
            ...     set([2,3,4])
            ... )
            &gt;&gt;&gt; setOfSets.valueForKeyPath_("@distinctUnionOfSets.self")
            {(
                3,
                2,
                1,
                4
            )}
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>Rather than setting up a whole new Xcode project for your experiments, you can simply keep a terminal window (or TextMate) open next to your main project. As a means of interactive testing, it sure beats the pants off of GDB.</p>
            
            <p>Things get even more interesting when you consider using PyObjC to create actual tools that support your Objective-C development. For example, here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/910824">a fully functional tool I wrote to help localize Core Data model files</a>. While I've concluded that PyObjC isn't very good for developing GUI-based apps, it's perfect for self-contained tasks like this one.</p>
            
            <p>If you're learning iOS or Mac development, I highly suggest playing around with PyObjC. Use it while reading the documentation, to test things out, and just to generally make your life easier.</p>
