A lot has happened in the past month or two, but the biggest news from me is that I started working at Aviary, Inc. in mid-July. I've been spending a good deal of time at the office, and I'm loving every minute of it. Our building is in the heart of Manhattan, right next to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. We have an amazing roof and a really sketchy elevator. Hmm, reminds me of somewhere in Bushwick.
